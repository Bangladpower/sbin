<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3>What is bin.so?</h3>
<p>BIN.SO is minimalistic paste bin service focused on security:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Search engines are not allowed to crawl and index content of bin.so</li>
    <li>Each uploaded content is assigned with uniq random ID</li>
    <li>Uploaded content could be protected by password. Data is encrypted in the browser, then
        <b>encrypted</b> data sends to the server.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What happens if I protect content with password?</h3>
<p>First, data is encrypted on client-side, just inside browser. Then data is submitted to the
server. Server stores already encrypted data, it is not possible to read data even you have direct
access to the database.</p>
<p>When you open content's page the encrypted data is loaded from the server to web-browser. Then you
provide the password and it is used to decrypt data and display it in the browser</p>
